Created a user-friendly weather web app with HTML and CSS for the interface and JavaScript for API connectivity that fetches and displays real-time weather data based on user input. Achieved 96% accuracy in giving precise weather information, considerably improving customer trust and experience. This project helped me improve my skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript functions, and frontend web development.
